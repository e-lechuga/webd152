    <h1>Best coffee shop in San Diego</h1>
    <p>Public Square is one of those coffee shops that just feels easy to be in. The coffee is solid, the vibe is relaxed, and it’s a nice place just to hang out. My two favorite drinks are the sesame latte and the pandan latte. The scones are also super good, highly recommend, 10/10.</p>
